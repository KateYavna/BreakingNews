        but the Netherlands avoided fatalities. </string>
    <string name="flood_tragedy_text">As communities devastated by the catastrophic flooding in parts
        of western Europe start picking up the pieces, they are wondering how it all went so wrong,
        so fast. After all, Europe has a world-leading warning system that issued regular alerts for days before
        floods engulfed entire villages.

But at least 195 people still died in Germany and Belgium, in floods that came quickly and forcefully.
        The Copernicus Emergency Management Service said it sent more than 25 warnings for specific regions
        of the Rhine and Maas river basins in the days leading up to the flooding, through its European Flood Awareness
        System (EFAS), well before heavy rains triggered the flash flooding.
But few of these early warnings appear to have been passed on to residents early -- and clearly -- enough,
        catching them completely off guard. Now questions are being raised over whether the chain of communication
        from the central European level to regions is working.</string>
